# Dream Job Skill Guide

The Dream Job Skill Guide will expand upon the starter project. It aims to assist the user in revealing the
skills needed to get their dream job. We assume that there are two potential scenarios: user A, who knows
their dream job, and user B, who does not, and is exploring options based on skills related to their current
job.

For user A, our project will allow them to input two job titles, ‘current’ and ‘dream’, and then generate a list
of the top five skills that would be needed to transition from their current job title to their dream job title.
The skill recommendations will be based on importance to the job title and the level required.

For user B, our project will allow them to first select their current job title and then generates five related job
titles. These suggested titles will be based on how closely related the high importance skills are between the
chosen job title and the recommended job titles.
