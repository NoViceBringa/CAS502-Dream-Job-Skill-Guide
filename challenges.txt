Technical Challenge: We have beginner level Python skills and have not done network-related analysis, like
the one in the starter project. Learning Python while building new features on top of the starter project will
be challenging.

Process Challenge: We are in diﬀerent time zones (PT vs CT) and have limited time during the week for
assignments, which leaves little room for error checking and rework as assignments are due on Sunday by
midnight.

Teamwork Challenge: We have similar gaps in our Python skills. Additionally, we have similar strengths and
weaknesses, which could lead to diﬀiculties in compensating for each other’s weaknesses.
