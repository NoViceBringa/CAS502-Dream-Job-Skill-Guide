- Slack messages will be our main mode of communication. We will reserve Slack huddles for more
complicated discussions.

- We have more time on weekends. We aim to cover course materials and plan our work during the
week. We will share drafts with each other by midnight on Saturday, leaving Sunday for review and
revisions before the final submission time.
